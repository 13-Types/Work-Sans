'Work Sans' (former working title 'Alice')
===

A SIL Open Font project titled 'Work Sans' (former working title 'Alice') for Latin and Telugu.

Work Sans is a superfamily based loosely on early Grotesques — i.e. [Stephenson Blake](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/14444337254/), [Miller & Richard](https://archive.org/stream/printingtypespec00millrich#page/226/mode/2up/) and [Bauerschen Giesserei](https://archive.org/stream/hauptprobeingedr00baue#page/109/mode/1up). There will be 9 weights across 5 widths. The core of the fonts are designed for on-screen medium-sized text usage (14px-48px). The fonts closer to the extreme widths and weights are designed for display use. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions – for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print.

Source files have been partly prepared for use in [Metapolator](http://www.metapolator.com). 

*Note: UFOs are exported from Glyphs App and will currently not export properly due to using '[Bracket trick](http://www.glyphsapp.com/tutorials/alternating-glyph-shapes)' and '[Brace trick](http://www.glyphsapp.com/tutorials/additional-masters-for-individual-glyphs-the-brace-trick)' to solve interpolation bumps. Glyphs marked grey are brace/bracket glyphs*

The project started in June 2014 and the brief was to have a [minimum viable product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (alpha release with 9 weights) by December 2014.

The Telugu glyph set comes from [Ramabhadra](http://teluguvijayam.org/fonts.html) by Silicon Andhra. Glyphs marked red in the file are those that have been manually cleaned up, the rest are automatically cleaned up with FontForge from Ramabhadra.
